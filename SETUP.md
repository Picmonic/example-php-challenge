## Environment setup
This example was developed using Laravel Homestead (http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead) which utilizes a vagrant box to initialize the environment.
Once you have installed the box and mapped the folders you can pull this code down and place it in the root directory you mapped.
You will access the site according to the configuration in your Homestead.yaml

##Usage
/commits will take you to a list of the most recent commits.  Each record links to the commit on github by clicking the hash, or you can click the author name to see other commits in the database from that author.
