## Message

Thanks for taking the time to look over this. As we discussed in the interview I had not previously used Laravel, so I spent yesterday learning about the framework and today I completed the challenge. It was fun and I enjoyed learning about Laravel.

If you were wondering why it took longer to complete, I had a few techinical issues with my computer which slowed down my progress significantly. Thank you for your time.
