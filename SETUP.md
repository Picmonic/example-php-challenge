# Project Setup
Provisioning of the project uses Vagrant + VirtualBox to provision a guest VM environment.

  1. cd to the project directory
  2. run the following command `vagrant up`
  3. visit `https://machine1.puphpet/` in your browser

Installation of composer and bower dependencies, as well as database initialization is handled during initial provisioning.
