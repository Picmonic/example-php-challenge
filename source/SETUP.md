# Github Challenge

Fairly simple to use. I chose to use Scotch Box, Laravel, Bootstrap, and MongoDB. I chose [Scotch Box][l1] instead of Homestead due to having more familiarity with Scotch Box.

### Installation

```sh
$ cd /path/to/dir/
$ vagrant up
```

Once finished you can now browse to [http://192.168.33.10/][l2] and explore. Enjoy!
